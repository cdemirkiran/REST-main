# ascribe REST API

Main RESTful API for ascribe ownership web service. https://www.ascribe.io

- First public release: 2015-04-26
- Current public release: 2015-07-01, version 0.1


## Overview
Integration has these actions:

1. Register your app/marketplace and request an access token. This is a one time action.
2. Register a piece.
3. Check the status of a piece.

## Authorization Flow
Let's call the marketplace Makx.

As authentication is used to connect and transfer data between Makx and ascribe, we
use an encrypted connection (HTTPS).

Ascribe authorizes applications via tokens. Each token is an alphanumeric that
encodes the following information:

- The ID of the application that was granted access.
- The ID of the user who granted access to personal data.
- A set of actions available to the application.

## Register your Application or Marketplace
The developer (e.g. admin@makx.com) should have an [ascribe account](https://www.ascribe.io), 
login and go to settings>API settings to register
the application or marketplace with following fields:

- Name: `name of the marketplace`

The user can then create a token of type 'Bearer'.
